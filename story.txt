It's only 455.8 miles from Berlin to Schloss Eltz.
Which can be represented by 4,813,248 six-inch Bratwursts laid end on end.
Wearing Lederhose, he danced through the festival, embodying the spirit of the vibrant culture.
But strangely a hund arrived, stealing his Apfelkuchen from his pocket of his lederhose.
The hund then hopped into his Porsche and raced to the nearest Flughafen while blasting Rammstein on the radio. 
It was well known that Rammestein was the cultural music of the hund. The band reminded him of its youth chasing BMW owners for doener.
At one point he did it professionally, as he was very wettbewerbsfaehig!
But before he raced to Schloss Eltz, he had to go to the baeckerei to get a gebaeck for his mother.
At the baeckerei, the hund mistook a giant pretzel for a fetching stick.
After the Hund got the Gebaeck for his mother, he stopped at a nearby Biergarten for a quick drink and some merriment.
The Hund approached the bartender in the ratskellar. The bartender was confused - "a talking dog in my biergarten?"
At which the Hund responded, "A talking dog is no such strange thing, now a Hund in Lederhose or a Dirndel would be strange."
With his interest piqued, the Hund left the Biergarten and made his way to Hauptstrasse, wondering if he could meet other wettbewerbsfaehige Hunde at the Mehlhase competition.
On his way he turned on the Klimaanlage in his Porsche, then began to cough up the backpocket of the lederhose he had stolen the Apfelkuchen from.
